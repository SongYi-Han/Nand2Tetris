# Nand2Tetris :Building a modern computer from scratch
https://www.nand2tetris.org/course  
  
We will build the hardware platform of a simple yet powerful computer, called Hack (a 16-bit computer equipped with a
screen and a keyboard). Once hardware platform is ready, then we will also build the computerâ€™s software hierarchy, consisting of an assembler, a virtual machine, a simple Java-like language called Jack, a compiler for it, and a mini operating system, written in Jack.
